Initially want to deploy and test diamond with diamondDeploy
Then we deploy through the registry and run same tests



Status - Diamond currently being deploy via diamondDeploy and passing all diamond related tests 

What needs to be deployed through registry?
Just bytecode of diamondDeploy and optimizations
Facets should be fairly static and be verified at the community's leisure


//Implement Registry Deployment
//Implement Initialization Sequence
