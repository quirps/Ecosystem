We want to create a deploymentEnvironment for unit testing and testing frontend API/Database interactions.

For Frontend integrated tests:
We first deploy a registry contract as owner. 
We then upload a version.
    This involves creating a diamondDeploy contract and deploying the facets.
    Then uploading those to the registry contract 
Now each user can deploy ecosystems 
Once deployed can set various initializations needed, including but not exclusive:
    Token/Ticket ids/amounts and associated distribution
    Moderators 
    Sales 
    Version 
    Members
Config file would need to be set for each ecosystem 
CLI would take in a config file path relative to calling directory 
Need to import ecosystem util as a package
option to load saved state and database associated with that state 
For now just redeploy test setup, save a static DB for static testing case. 
Need deploySequence for each version
versions should have an action or initialitation file
