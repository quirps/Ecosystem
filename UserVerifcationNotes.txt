How verify members?

An ecosystem could enable logged in users (on a given social media platform) to send their 
ethereum address. Ecosystem would then routinely upload a merkle root which would verify 
struct Member exists (as a leaf of the tree). 

struct Member{
    username:"...",
    platform:"...",
    rank: ""
}
