Deploy and Initialization Sequences are separate

First we will go over deploy sequence (without registry), and then 
go over what needs to be created. 
deploy
======================
1. deploy diamondDeploy contract
2. call the deployBytecode method and retrieve address
3. deploy all contracts associated with this version 
4. cut the contracts to the diamond 

initialize
======================
1. read config file and sequentially deploy each ecosystem


/*
Diamond for the registry? This would enable dynamic typing, which would be needed for optimizations.
Focus on that later, still too dependent on optimization properties to consider at this point.
