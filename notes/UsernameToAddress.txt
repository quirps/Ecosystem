How to associate username with address? 
Initially a user can set their address right away.

Owner will uploada merkle root of tree whose leaves consist
of username and address. 
Member proves this fact and in turn associates username with address
Members can set an address change delay (default 24hrs)

An EcoSystem Util which helps verify members? How would this really help? 
Going to take two calls anyway unless ecosystems are built with call & delegate call
functionality in fallback. 

2 Patterns. 
  1. 
    dApp calls the ecosystem util first which then routes to the respective ecosystem.
    ecosystem can simply use msgSender() verify the  trusted contract. 
  2. all calls go through ecosystem, which can perform external calls to trusted 
     contracts before continuing

Option 1 seems more natural and easier to use, as the second option would require
new dapps using these services understand how call data works more previsely.

Only main issue is you're adding new addresses, which the ecosystem does...

Option 1 it is.


-----------------------------------------

How do deal with case where user initially has a bad address? User who has
control of twitch account has authority to change. Would also need an override feature
where owner/moderator could put a 2 week change, where 


How about initially, from when first verifying, there is a week-long delay until verified.
So if a user verifies membership with an initial address, it takes 7 days to be locked in.
Moderators can also, on a case-by-case basis, a 2 week verification process which can
be cancelled by the logged in user at anytime.
