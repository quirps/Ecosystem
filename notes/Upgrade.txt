How can ecosystem owners upgrade/deploy their diamonds?

Fortunately diamonds only need to be upgraded after initial deployment

Flow:
Owner deploys via online app w/ metamask 
Later changes owner to their multisig
Once diamond deployed, all user has to do is facetCut method
Extension will have an independent verification for deployment 

How to uniquely identify a version? concat the bytecode and take 
keccack256 (facet bytecode is ordered by lowest address to highest)

Each version has an associated hash.
Hashes stored in extension, repo, website.
