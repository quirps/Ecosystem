Everytime one can eliminate a quasi-static variable, you save 2100*x gas per use.

With this Diamond Version implementation, would there be a way for EcoOwners to redeploy
to make things cheaper?

Quasistatic variables should also be looked at from a redeployment perspective. 
Ecosystem Diamond structures shouldn't change too much, as facets must be gas optimized
as is. Instead of making a variable for version change, just mark the facet as ready for
an update.
