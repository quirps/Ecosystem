Need high level of interaction and usage of ecosystems. 
How to do this? 

Code will likely live in an extension, with main app accesible on website. Mobile
app can come later.

How can Interactive Dapps be imported?

Likely would need to be vetted, that way they can be statically built, security
and efficiency purposes. 

Would need a play/app store meant for ecosystems, create a list of items.
